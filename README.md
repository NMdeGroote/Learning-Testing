# RStudio Learning Journey 

This repository tracks my individual learning process in RStudio. The coming two years I will run it alongside my pre-master and master in Finance at the University of Groningen (RUG). R is a part of the curriculum in this study. However, the goal is to take my skills beyond what’s taught in class and develop a stronger foundation in data analysis for finance.

I have had multiple courses involving data analysis in RStudio before, during my Bachelor’s in International Business Administration at the University of Twente. These courses were challenging, but they sparked a strong interest in data and programming. I spent a lot of time learning outside of class, and ultimately achieved my highest grades in those subjects. That experience made it clear to me that I wanted to pursue data analysis as a part of my future career.

That’s why I’ve returned to RStudio with the goal of (re)building my skills from the ground up — not just to repeat what I’ve learned, but to push my abilities to a higher and more professional level alongside my (pre)master. Furthermore, besides this initiative I will allocate time to further my mathematical skills from what I have been left with from my previous education, to prepare for my following (pre)master I will first master the appropriate mathematcial level needed for this upcoming study, this will take me from the 15th of january until the 1st of september.


## What You'll Find Here

This branch includes exercises, tests, and smaller pieces of code where I explore how things work. These come from:

- My own textbooks
- Online resources (e.g. DataCamp, tutorials, blog posts)
- Ideas that match my current level and help me progress step by step
- Example problems that other coders have given in this online working space

Everything here is part of me building a better understanding of how to use R in practical situations.

Each file might include:
- Exercises and practice tasks
- Comments in the code explaining what I'm doing and why
- Notes on what I learned or struggled with
- A reflection on progress made in Github

## Structure

This repository is structured as follows:


## Topics I'm Working On (Checklist):

[] Simple regression analysis
...

## Who This Is For

This is mainly for my personal development, but also for:

- Employers who want to see my progress and initiative
- Universities or programs that want to see what I’ve been working on
- Anyone curious about how I’m learning R

This is a work-in-progress repository. Some code will be clean, some messy.
